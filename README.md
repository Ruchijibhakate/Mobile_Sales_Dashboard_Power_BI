# 📱 Mobile Sales Dashboard: Uncovering Insights Through Power BI 📊
Hello LinkedIn community! 👋🏼

I’m thrilled to share my latest Power BI project, where I developed a Mobile Sales Dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable insights for sales performance tracking and decision-making. 📈📱

This dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of mobile phone sales data, enabling users to monitor key metrics, identify sales trends, and uncover business opportunities in real-time. Using Power BI’s powerful data visualization and DAX capabilities, I built an interactive report that showcases the potential of data analytics in driving smart business decisions.

🚀 Key Features of the Dashboard:
🔹 Dynamic KPIs: Track Total Sales, Quantity Sold, Profit, and more
🔹 Brand-wise & Model-wise Performance Analysis
🔹 Monthly & Regional Sales Trends
🔹 Interactive filters to drill down into customer preferences

📌 Technologies Used:
Power BI | DAX | Data Cleaning | Data Modeling | Data Visualization

This project highlights how data visualization tools like Power BI can empower businesses to stay ahead by converting data into clear, meaningful insights.
